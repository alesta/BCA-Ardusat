BCA Makerspace Ardusat implementation
=====================================

This is a project by the BCA Makerspace to do scientific experiments in space using the Ardusat satellite.

For more information on Ardusat check out its kickstarter:

To build
--------
We recommend using <a href="http://www.inotool.org">ino</a> to build from the command line.  Use this command to build:

    ino build -m robotControl

This is redundant, however, as compilation is done by the Ardusat website software.  This is simply a check to make sure the program compiles at all.
